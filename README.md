# LANGUAGE_IDENTIFICATION_ML_PROJECT
This project builds an NLP-based language detection model that automatically identifies the language of a given text input. Using text vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier, the system efficiently classifies languages with high accuracy and supports real-time user input.
# Key Features 
•	Text Classification using NLP: Converts raw text into numerical features using CountVectorizer for efficient machine learning processing.
•	Supervised Machine Learning Model: Implements Multinomial Naive Bayes, a widely used algorithm for text classification problems.
•	Real-Time Language Prediction: Accepts custom user input and predicts the language instantly.
•	End-to-End ML Pipeline: Covers data analysis, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and inference.
# Tech Stack & Tools
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
•	Machine Learning: Supervised Learning, Naive Bayes
•	NLP Techniques: Text Vectorization, Bag of Words
•	Model Evaluation: Train-Test Split, Accuracy Score
# Model Workflow
1.	Data loading and exploration
