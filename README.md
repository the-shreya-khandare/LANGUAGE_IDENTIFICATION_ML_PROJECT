# LANGUAGE_IDENTIFICATION_ML_PROJECT
This project builds an NLP-based language detection model that automatically identifies the language of a given text input. Using text vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier, the system efficiently classifies languages with high accuracy and supports real-time user input.
